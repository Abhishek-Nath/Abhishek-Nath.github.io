		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">Fortnite is a zombie survival game in
		which players can either team up or play solo, to try and be the
		last contestant standing a la The Hunger Games. <br>
		Armed only with a pickaxe, players commence to rounding up weapons
		and supplies to build fortifications, to try and fend off the
		coming undead horde. <br>
		Rated “T” for Teen, Fortnite has abundant violence. But the
		cartoon graphics don't have too much in the way of splattering
		blood or gore.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">PUBG stands for Player 	Unkwon Battle Ground.
			Its a battle Royale type game i.e all against all. There are three game modes: 1.Solo: single player, 2.Duo: two players, 3.Squad: four players<br>
			It starts with you skydiving with just an underwear.You reach the Ground and collect Clothes,Guns,Backpack,Firstaid kits,Energy drink,Ammo,etc.<br>
			But here comes a twist. You have to do this in a specified play area which shrinks with time making all players to be condesed in small area or you slowly die. With few players remaining the area shrinks to tiny size making the moment intense and heart-pounding. The last remaing team or player wins the game. To make game even better there are vehicles,suits,trees,bushes,water,speed boats etc</p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">CS:GO expands upon the team-based first person shooter gameplay the original Counter-Strike pioneered when it launched in 1999. Two teams compete in multiple rounds of objective-based game modes with the goal of winning enough rounds to win the match.<br>

		CS:GO features new maps, characters, and weapons and delivers updated versions of the classic Counter-Strike maps like Dust, Inferno, Nuke, Train, and more. In addition, CS:GO introduces new game modes like Arms Race, Flying Scoutsman and Wingman, and features online matchmaking and Competitive Skill Groups.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 50px; font-family: Helvetica; text-align: center;"><b>DEFENSE OF THE ANCIENTS</b></p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">Dota is an acronym that stands for Defense of the Ancients – a top-down multiplayer game that resembles the Real-Time Strategy (RTS) genre at first, but streamlines the gameplay from controlling an entire army to controlling a single Hero.<br>
		The game pits two teams of five players against each other. Each team has a base with a central structure (called an “Ancient”) and the first team to destroy the other team’s Ancient wins the game – hence the game’s title. There are three pathways (called “lanes”) that connect the two bases and waves of soldier units (called “creeps”) are spawned on a periodic basis to travel these lanes, clashing with the opposite team’s creeps as they fight their way to the enemy’s base.

		<p style="font-size: 50px; font-family: Helvetica; text-align: center;"><b>OVERWATCH</b></p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">In Overwatch, you control one of several heroes in competitive 6-person team shooting matches. Battle over objectives, take down the other team, and achieve victory.<br>
		Before you begin a game of Overwatch, you’ll need to choose a hero to play.Maybe controlling a cannon-toting, genetically-engineered ape from the moon appeals to you. Or, you might prefer zipping around as a teleporting, time-traveling freedom fighter. Who do you want to be?
		<br> 
		In Overwatch, heroes do battle in diverse locations around the world. From the technological marvel of Numbani to the manufacturing powerhouse of Volskaya, each map has a unique layout and specific win conditions that your team must meet in order to secure victory.</p>
